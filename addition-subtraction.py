# CSC500 Module 1 Critical Thinking Assisgnment
# Lincoln Quick
# Part 1:
# Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
# Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, 
# add them together to find the output. Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.

# Ask the user to input two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the addition and subtraction of the two numbers
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2

# Display the results
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {addition}")
print(f"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is {subtraction}")
